This chal is truly typical but perhaps not immediate, is it?

Hint for beginners: On the remote server, the program runs. Let's connect to the server by nc 35.221.81.216 30002 The goal of this chal is to execute /bin/sh to get the access to the remote server. After that, you can find a flag file in the server. Read it, please.

How to get the shell: If you hardly know pwning techniques, it will be a good starting point to search the following words on the Internet.

    Format String Bug
    GOT (Global Offset Table) Overwrite
    Buffer Overflow
    Return Oriented Programming
    sigreturn syscall

In my opinion, the techniques above are enough for you to solve this chal. (In fact, some of them are required.) Of course, you have to do trial and error.

Note that I think it is difficult to solve this chal just by one line code. I recommend you to write a solver script. I attached a template for solver scripts with pwntools. Feel free to use it.
